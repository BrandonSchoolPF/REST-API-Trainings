# Flow control: loops, and if statements

This coding exercise has two steps.

Modify the code so that the `evens` list contains only the even `numbers` of the numbers list. You do not need to print anything.

For part 2, add a clause to the if statement such that if the user's input is `"q"`, your program prints `"Quit"`.

Remember that for these coding exercises, Python will care about uppercase and lowercase letters, so make sure to use the right ones!
