# Dictionaries and Students

This coding exercise has three parts. See them outlined inÂ detail in the coding exercise, as comments.

1. Create a dictionary variable, called `student`.
2. Modify a variable, `grades`, so it contains the value of a dictionary's key.
3. Implement a function calculating a total average grade for a class of students.
