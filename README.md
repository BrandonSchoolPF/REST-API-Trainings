# Python Refresher Exercises

This repository contains a series of exercises to help you refresh your Python knowledge. It's intended to be used as a companion to the [Python Refresher Course](https://tecladocode.com/python-refresher).

## How to attempt the exercises

First, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tecladocode/python-refresher-exercises
```

Then, open the repository with your editor of choice (I recommend Visual Studio Code).

You'll find a few folders, one per exercise. Each folder contains a `README.md` file with the instructions for the exercise, a `student.py` file with some starter code, and a `tests.py` file with some tests.

For example, for exercise 1, open `01_variables/README.md` and read the instructions.

Then:

- Rename `01_variables/exercise.py` to `01_variables/solution.py`.
- Rename `01_variables/student.py` to `01_variables/exercise.py`.
- Attempt your solution in the new `exercise.py` file.

Once you're ready, run the tests by going into the folder and running unittest:

```
cd 01_variables
python -m unittest
```

You should see `OK` printed out, and that means it's all good!

If you want to check the instructor's solution, that's in the old `exercise.py` (now called `solution.py`) file.
