# Classes and Objects

This coding exercise requires you to complete an implementation of three methods of a class:

1. The `__init__` method, which should take an argument, `name`. It should initialise `self.name` to be the argument, and `self.items` to be an empty list.
2. The `add_item` method, which should append a dictionary representing an item to the store's `items` property. The dictionary should have keys `name` and `price`.
3. The `stock_price` method, which should add up each item price inside `self.items` to come up with a total, and return that.

Good luck!
