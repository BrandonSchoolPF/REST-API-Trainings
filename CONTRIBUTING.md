Create a new branch for your coding exercise.

Make sure to create the following files in each exercise directory:

* `README.md`: a description of the problem for students to read.
* `exercise.py`: the solution of the problem.
* `tests.py`: the tests that will check the problem has been solved correctly. Make sure to check as many edge cases as possible!
* `student.py`: the starting code we'll provide the students. You can add comments here and any required code.
* `__init__.py`: required so the test runner will be able to run these tests automatically.

Then, make a PR into `master`!
