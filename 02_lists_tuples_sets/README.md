# Lists, Tuples, and Sets

This coding exercise requires you to complete three steps:

1. Create a list, called `my_list`, with three numbers. The total of the numbers added together should be 100.
2. Create a tuple, called `my_tuple`, with a single value in it
3. Modify the variable `set2` so that `set1.intersection(set2)` returns `{5, 77, 9, 12}`.
